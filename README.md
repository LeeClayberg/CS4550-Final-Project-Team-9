# Final Project - Comics Control

For my final project I want to make a website for people to look up comic book information and keep track of their own comic book inventory. Many people (including my dad) have collected comic books when they were younger and just have them stored in boxes collecting dust. This website will be able hold the user’s collection and display information about all the comics using the search feature. Some people might want to search for which comic books have which characters. The users will be able to find all this information on the site. Two types of users that would use the web application are the collectors(users) and the admin(s). Two goals the collector would have is to record their collection in their profile and be able to look up other comic books using the search feature. Two goals the admin would have is to keep track of the users and moderate reviews made by the users on the comic books. 

Each user will have their own comic book collection which will be found on their profile. Using a search bar the user can look up comic book information and/or add the comic book to their collection. For someone without an account they will still be able to look up the information on the comic books but they cannot save to a collection. The users will be able to easily look at their own inventory and, if they choose, can make their collection public to anyone. They will also be able to mark the comic books in their inventory with a grade using the ten-point grading scale. I have found a few great APIs for this information below. I hope to possibly find a pricing api for the comic books but I have yet to find one that's reliable. That could be an added bonus for the users. The admin will be able to view all the user’s information from an admin page and view and/or delete reviews made by users.

Two possible APIs I will use

https://www.programmableweb.com/api/comic-vine

https://www.programmableweb.com/api/marvel-comics

The Comic Vine API lets the user access and search through thousands of comic books, characters, creators and publishers. The database also includes information on concepts, locations, powers and objects within the comic books. The marvel Comics API provides information on creators, characters, series, storylines, individual issues, and crossover events in the Marvel Universe.
